1) whats the probability of getting 1, 2, 3, 4 gametes as a function of # observations?
2) Whats the probability of a site fialing as a function of # observations?
3) Given some confidence threshold (see above), whats the probability of a particular site failing?
    - I don't understand this part. We need to go from p(fail | # obs) = > p(fail | counts)
    - p(1 | # obs) p(2 | # obs) p( 3 | # obs) p (4 | # obs)
    - given 1, 2, 3, 4,
        we already generated this data
        how do we turn this into a pass/fail test
4) Which sites are the most disruptive?
5) What is the mean proportion of gametes for each site?
