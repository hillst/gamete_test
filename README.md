Gamete test is as follows:

for every pair of sites:
    How many combinations of gametes do we see? that is:
        00
        01
        10
        11

    If you see all 4 gametes then there is no perfect phylogeny.

Idea:
    do this for all sites and see how this looks genome wide.

Problems:
    filtering criteria? well we need atleast 4 cells, but more would be better!

    First pass? lets look at normal b cells
